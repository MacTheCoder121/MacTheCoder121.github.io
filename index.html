<h2>The Uratama</h2>
<p>The Uratama (Ura Jinsei Enjoi Tamagotchi Purasu) is a tamagotchi that first settled
    <br>
In Japan, but then got brought over to the USA and other reigons known as the "Tamagotchi
<br>
 Connection V4.5"
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The uratama is similar to the Connection V4 with the similarities being Jobs and different
    <br>
    types of character groups,and etc!
</p>
<br>
<p>
    The Ura tama is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doppelg%C3%A4nger">doppelganger</a> of the original
    <br>
    Tamagotchis. The appearance of the tamagotchi is a blue screen, a antenna with a cute little star on top, and a chain.
</p>
<br>
<p>In my opinion, the Uratama is so weird and thats what I love about it.</p>
